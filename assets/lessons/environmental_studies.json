It includes plants, animals, microorganisms, soil, water, and sunlight. Each organism has a specific roleâ€”producers (like plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (fungi and bacteria). Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms within an ecosystem. High biodiversity makes ecosystems more resilient to changes and supports human life by providing food, medicine, and clean air. Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and climate change threaten ecosystems. Conservation efforts like protected areas, sustainable farming, and afforestation help preserve biodiversity. Understanding ecosystems is crucial for protecting our planet and ensuring a balanced environment for future generations."
