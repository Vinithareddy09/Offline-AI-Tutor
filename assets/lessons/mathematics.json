The top number is called the numerator, and the bottom is the denominator. Decimals are another way of expressing fractions, using a decimal point. For example, 0.5 is equal to 1/2. These two forms are interchangeable. Operations on fractions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each requires a specific method. For example, to add fractions, they must have the same denominator. To convert a decimal to a fraction, identify the place value of the last digit (e.g., 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4). Fractions and decimals are fundamental in daily life—from cooking measurements to financial calculations—and mastering them builds a strong foundation for higher mathematics like algebra and data analysis."
