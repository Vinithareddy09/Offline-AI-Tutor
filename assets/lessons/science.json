    "content": "The human heart is a muscular organ roughly the size of a fist, located slightly to the left of the center of the chest. It is part of the circulatory system and plays a vital role in transporting oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. The heart functions as a dual pump — the right side receives deoxygenated blood from the body and sends it to the lungs, while the left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body.\n\nThe heart is made up of four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right atrium receives blood from the body and passes it to the right ventricle, which then pumps it to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and sends it to the left ventricle, which then pumps it through the aorta to the entire body.\n\nValves between these chambers ensure the blood flows in one direction and prevent backflow. These include the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The rhythmic contraction of the heart muscle is controlled by electrical signals originating in a group of cells known as the sinoatrial (SA) node — the heart’s natural pacemaker.\n\nHeart health is crucial for survival. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking can help maintain a healthy heart. Medical conditions like hypertension, coronary artery disease, or arrhythmias can impair heart function and may require medical intervention.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy and function of the heart is foundational in biology and health science, and it helps us appreciate the importance of maintaining cardiovascular health."
