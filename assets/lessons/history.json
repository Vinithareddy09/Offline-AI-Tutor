It began in 1789 and lasted until 1799, marking the end of monarchy in France and the rise of democratic ideals. Causes of the revolution included economic hardship, inequality between social classes, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas. The French society was divided into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the common people (Third Estate), who bore most of the tax burden. Key events included the storming of the Bastille, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and the execution of King Louis XVI. The revolution introduced concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity. It also led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. Though violent and chaotic at times, the French Revolution inspired future movements for democracy and social reform around the world."
