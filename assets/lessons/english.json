    "content": "Topic: Parts of Speech\n\nIn English grammar, parts of speech are categories that define the role words play in a sentence. There are eight main parts of speech:\n\n1. Nouns: Name people, places, or things (e.g., dog, city).\n2. Pronouns: Replace nouns (e.g., he, she, it).\n3. Verbs: Indicate actions or states (e.g., run, is).\n4. Adjectives: Describe nouns (e.g., tall, beautiful).\n5. Adverbs: Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., quickly, very).\n6. Prepositions: Show relationships between nouns or pronouns and other words (e.g., in, on, under).\n7. Conjunctions: Connect words or clauses (e.g., and, but, because).\n8. Interjections: Express emotions (e.g., wow!, ouch!).\n\nUnderstanding the parts of speech is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and improving both writing and speaking skills."
